# Advanced Python C-API Guide

This project contains various examples for the python C-API usage. Each example is a standalone module, which can be build with the setup.py by "python2 setup.py build". Just switch into the build folder above the module and you may import any module function or class within the example by

```python
from my_module import *
# use the classes or functions
```
